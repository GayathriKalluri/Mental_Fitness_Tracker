## Introduction

The Mental Fitness Tracker project is a data analysis and visualization tool that aims to explore and analyze mental health and substance use disorder data. It utilizes two datasets, 'mental-and-substance-use-as-share-of-disease -AI.csv' and 'prevalence-by-mental-and-substance-use-disorder_AI.csv,' to provide insights into mental health trends and prevalence rates.

## Project Description

Mental health is an essential aspect of overall well-being, and tracking and understanding mental health statistics can help identify trends and inform public health policies. The Mental Fitness Tracker project uses Jupyter Notebook (mental_fitness_tracker.ipynb) to perform data analysis, visualization, and generate interactive charts to better comprehend the mental health landscape.

## Data Sets

The project uses two datasets for analysis:

1. **mental-and-substance-use-as-share-of-disease -AI.csv**: This dataset contains information about the proportion of mental and substance use disorders concerning the total disease burden. It includes various indicators related to different mental health conditions.

2. **prevalence-by-mental-and-substance-use-disorder_AI.csv**: This dataset provides prevalence rates and related information for specific mental and substance use disorders. It includes data for different countries or regions over time.

Please ensure that you have these datasets available in the project directory or provide the appropriate file paths in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation

To run the Mental Fitness Tracker project, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

Clone this repository or download the 'mental_fitness_tracker.ipynb' file and the two dataset files ('mental-and-substance-use-as-share-of-disease -AI.csv' and 'prevalence-by-mental-and-substance-use-disorder_AI.csv').

## Usage

1. Ensure you have installed all the necessary dependencies (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the 'mental_fitness_tracker.ipynb' notebook in Jupyter.
4. Execute the cells sequentially to run the analysis and generate visualizations.
5. Explore the insights and trends in mental health and substance use disorder data.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing: The project handles loading and preprocessing of the datasets.
- Data analysis: The notebook performs descriptive statistics and data exploration.
- Data visualization: Interactive charts and plots are generated to visualize mental health trends.
- Comparative analysis: The project may compare mental health data between different regions or over time.
